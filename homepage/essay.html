            <h1>Whoever has enough</h1>
            <p>North 11th street and Roebling is where I first lived. We had enough money to afford the rent. I still remember the neighborhood: the small bar on the corner, the small garden tended to by an old israeli man named Amir, my friend who lived down the street and now goes to the same school as me, the small pizza place, the deli, the park I used to play soccer in every sunday, Paulie, who had white hair and would smoke cigarettes and cough loudly while walking his dalmatian, I had lived there for 8 years.</p>

            <p>The first change to happen was my home. Some developers had enough money to buy the building and made us leave so they could tear it and the adjacent building down. We agreed on leaving in eight days, but they decided they wanted us gone sooner. Asbestos blown into the hallways from the basement worked well, and so we left on day 2. We attempted to sue but the lawyer advised against it, “They have enough money to drag this out and bleed you dry.” Everytime I come back I recognize it less and less. The only resemblance this foreign building now occupying the same space as my old home has is its location, with two doors to separate halves, a flimsy mockery of the titans that once stood parallel. The new building is twice as tall with an exterior made of garish pink bricks with white spots, a far cry from the plastic red shingle walls that once made up my idea of what the outside of a house looks like.</p>

            <p>Amir has left now, he moved to Canada in 2018 to better care for his mother. I stop by the garden every once in a while and help the volunteers that now care for what facilitated most of my time spent before school. I don't see Paulie walking around anymore, the deli shut down however long ago, the store is empty to this day. The pizza place is now a dog salon, they were bought out by people with enough money, the bar now has a fresh coat of paint, some new decorations and a fancy minimalist name, to lure in those passing by. And the empty lot nearby is now a taunting, horrid, monument to change made of glass and steel. Something that poses emotional significance only to those who remember what came before it.</p>

            <p>The rent is two thousand fifty dollars more, the parks filled with faces I’ve never seen, all with enough money to live somewhere we once did. And it fills me with this unrest, the knowledge that I was there before them, and that a simple greed that caused one person wanting a number to be bigger has uprooted my connection to what once made up my idea of what home is. Yet nothing can be conveyed, this New York that was once mine, torn down and made pretty for the people who rich home renovators decided would like it more than we did. The shops changed to better fit its new demographic, the buildings changed to look more appealing. A pretty veil to hide the unethical basis of this changing of scenery. Erasing what once was, in favor of what will make enough money to make them happier.</p>
